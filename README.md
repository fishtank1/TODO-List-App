# TODO-List-App
## A simple To-Do app  to have track on your daily goals. 
This is the best project to get started or introduced to backend development. In this project I tried to implement what I learned from my backend course from coding ninjas and solidfy them. 
In this project I worked with Mongo DB, Express, Embedded JS and Node JS along with the pillar of web HTML, CSS and JS. 
I tried to keep the code clean and have a proper directory structure as thaught by my mentor in coding ninjas, respected Arpan Garg. 

To get a look of what in the project, follow the following steps: 
1. Download the project file and extract it. 
2. Open VS code in the project folder. 
3. Go to terminal and make sure the terminal path is set to project folder. 
4. Run this command: npm install (will install the required files for the project)
5. Finally, run the project with this command: node index.js and open browser and search localhost:8000
